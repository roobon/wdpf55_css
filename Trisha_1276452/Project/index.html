            <h2>Rating agency ISS ESG assesses Audi: good ESG performance</h2>
            <p>In addition to its business performance, Audi strives to make a valuable contribution to society and the environment. The goal is to minimize its impact on the environment and to ensure that its impact on society is as positive as possible. In order to measure the results of these efforts, AUDI AG underwent the internationally respected ESG rating process of the independent rating agency ISS ESG. As a first step, the company is satisfied with its C+ rating and, at the same time, has been given important impetus for improvement. </p>
