            <p>The history of AUDI AG extends back to the 19th century. Find out more about the great personalities from the company’s 100-plus years of history. Learn about the fascinating evolution of the various models and major milestones in the fields of car manufacturing, motorcycle, engine production and motor racing.</p>
            <p>At the end of 1945, leading employees of the Auto Union in the old garrison town of Ingolstadt set up a depot for Auto Union spare parts. On September 3, 1949, this led to the formation of Auto Union GmbH, an independent manufacturing company that was released from its former ties. Later that same year, work began on the manufacture of delivery vans and motorcycles.


                In the early stages, it was the tried-and-tested DKW products with their two-stroke engines that were built once more under the sign of the four rings. During the period of deprivation in the years following the war, there was a need for ro
                
                From 1954 onwards, Friedrich Flick gradually acquired a large stake in the equity of Auto Union GmbH. His strategy was to find a strong partner for Auto Union in the medium term. In April 1958, Daimler-Benz AG acquired 88 percent of Auto Union's shares and in the following year the Ingolstadt company became a fully-owned subsidiary.

                <h1>Reborn the Audi 100 forms a clean break</h1>
                <p>A reliance on the two-stroke engine, a lack of model policy and increasingly critical press coverage meant that sales of DKW vehicles were on a downward spiral throughout the early 1960s. Against this backdrop, Daimler-Benz commissioned the engineer Ludwig Kraus, who was brought in as Technical Director in Ingolstadt, to adapt a four-cylinder, four-stroke engine, brought along as a kind of “dowry,” for the new DKW F 102 passenger car launched in 1963.
