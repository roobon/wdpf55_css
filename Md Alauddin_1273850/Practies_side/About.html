    <h3>Kerala in March: an ode to natural beauty!</h3>
    <p>Kerala is a pretty paradise for those looking for a natural retreat in the month of March in India. Godâ€™s Own Country, Kerala is at its finest right before the onset of summers. The prime attractions of the state are its backwaters, with houseboats ready to take you on a memorable journey. Stretches of canons and lakes, along with swaying coconut trees, and a spell of greenery offers an experience that one cannot find anywhere else</p>
